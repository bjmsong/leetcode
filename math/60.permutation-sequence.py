#
# The set [1,2,3,...,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.
# 
# By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the
# following sequence for n = 3:
# 
# 
# "123"
# "132"
# "213"
# "231"
# "312"
# "321"
# 
# 
# Given n and k, return the k^th permutation sequence.
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
# Given k will be between 1 and n! inclusive.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 3, k = 3
# Output: "213"
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 4, k = 9
# Output: "2314"
